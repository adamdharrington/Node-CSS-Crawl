Node CSS Crawl
======================

A customisable command line interface (CLI) tool for performing research on the usage of CSS on a sample of websites. By default the tool crawls the Alexa page-ranked top one million websites and writes a report to the current working directory.

Built on NodeJS and PhantomJS, Node CSS Crawl queries actual websites in a real headless browser context to give fast and accurate results.

Features
-----------------

Node CSS Crawl was built to perform research on the real-world usage of CSS on website using various front-end UI frameworks. As such the framework identification module was built to help identify unedited frameworks including Bootstrap, Foundation and Pure. It can easily be extended with new versions and frameworks.

The metrics used are a combination of descriptive indicators and code quality metrics from academic literature.
